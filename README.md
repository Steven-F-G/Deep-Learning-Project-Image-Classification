# Deep-Learning-Project-Image-Classification

Semester 6 Deep Learning Image Classification Mini Project-1

**Introduction:**
The problem specified is to predict image classification on a dataset
consisting of cell images from infected malaria patients and uninfected
samples. The dataset contains about 27,558 cell images which need to
be classified. To solve the problem at hand, a suitable CNN model is to
be created and validation is to be followed to test the accuracy and
efficacy of the proposed model.


**Dataset Details:**
The dataset has been obtained from the National Library of Medicine.
The cell images of the dataset have been obtained from a repository of
segmented cells from thin blood smear slide images from the Malaria
Screener research activity. The samples were extracted from a group of
150 infected people and about 50 uninfected people. This dataset
contains a total of 27,558 cell images with half being infected cells and
the other half being uninfected cells. The cells images are 128 x 128 in
resolution and are configured in 3 color channels.
The dataset is also part of a study conducted by a group of researchers
Published in 2018.
